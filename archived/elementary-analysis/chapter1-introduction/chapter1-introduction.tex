\chapter{Introduction}\label{cha:introduction}
Congratulations. You have finished the phase what we call secondary mathematical education, and are now ready to start your tertiary track. You are about to enter a brand new field of study---that of analysis, which is the first step you will take in your tertiary track. The goal of these complementary materials contained in this series is to help you prepare yourself with the sufficient background knowledge in order for you to understand our main texts, namely \cite{babyrudin} and \cite{zorich1}. We would like to emphasize that these materials are in no way a complete and self-contained text in mathematical analysis and a thorough read of one of our main text is critical to your study.
