\section{Mission Statement}
The craft of publishing and press adjoins humankind's history, and the need of knowledge distribution never dissipates. Forged on November 24th, 2019, the vision of the founders of the \textbf{Mathematikapolis} organization is to facilitate a part of this process in the unique way they crafted, i.e., a way that is \textbf{neutral, sound, fair, constructive, and considerate (NSFCC)}. It is the Mathematikapolis organization's mission to assist the mathematical community to learn and discover more. The Mathematikapolis organization serves this cause by providing the method of communication to the community while firmly standing with its standards.

\section{Definition of NSFCC}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Neutralness} - the act of distinguishment between opinions and facts; the use of non-judgemental language; and the indication of the prominence of the opposing views
\item \textbf{Soundness} - the state of statements being consistent and logically valid with respect to the semantics of the universe
\item \textbf{Fairness} - the impartial and just treatment of objects without favoritism or discrimination
\item \textbf{Constructiveness} - the quality in favor of or serving to the action of building and improvement
\item \textbf{Considerateness} - the conscious of positive awareness for the community's states and circumstances
\end{enumerate}
